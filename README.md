The simple coffee machine simulator. The coffee machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar,
and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. You can get three types 
of coffee: espresso, cappuccino, and latte. Since nothingâ€™s for free, it also collects the money.
